		  	  <h4>Let's get started...</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>In a medium heated saucepan, add 1 tbsp of the butter. </li>
					<li>Add the whole spices (cinnamon, bay leaves, green cardamom, cloves, pepper corns)to the melted butter and stir. The pepper corns and cloves will start puffing up slightly, which indicates that the spices are fusing with the butter.</li>
					<li>Add the largely chopped onions and tomatoes and stir.</li>
					<li>Add the chopped ginger and garlic and keep stirring.</li>
					<li>Add the red chillis and green chillis, and stir to mix.</li>
					<li>Add all the turmeric and some of the Kashmiri red chilli powder and mix.</li>
					<li>Add the salt, this will help to soften the tomatoes. Mix thoroughly.</li>
					<li>Add the water, mix, and cover the pan with a lid. Leave it to cook for 15 mins until the tomatoes and onions have softened.</li>
					<li>Remove the pieces of bay leaves and cinnamon stick from the mixture. We're going to add this mixture into a blender to grind all the cooked mixture into a fine paste.</li>
					<li>Once the mixture is a fine paste, pour this into a strainer and apply pressure to the mixture with a large spoon to extract its juice into a pot (view 5.15 of the video for a detailed demonstration). Keep applying pressure until as much juice as possible has been grinded out, and in the pot you are left with a silky puree.</li>
					<li>Now add the remaining 3 tbsp butter to the saucepan. Once melted, add the remaining Kashmiri red chilli powder and stir.</li>
					<li>Add the paneer and carefully mix it in. Try not to break the paneer cubes. Keep mixing until they're a little cooked on the sides.</li>
					<li>Add the puree from the pot to this pan with the paneer and stir occasionally.</li>
					<li>Add the sugar, and rub the dried fenugreek leaves in your palm over the pan to spread it throughout. Stir.</li>
					<li>Add the garam masala and stir.</li>
					<li>At this point you can do a salt taste check, because now we will be adding a 1/4 cup of water.</li>
					<li>Cover and cook for 5 mins, or until the gravy comes to a boil.</li>
					<li>Now you can drizzle the cream throughout, and gently mix. As a topping, you can spinkle the chopped coriander leaves on top.</li>
					<li>Enjoy, with naan or rice!</li>
